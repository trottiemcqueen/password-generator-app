## My process
1. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
3. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
4. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library - soon







### Continued development

I use this section to outline areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts I'm still not completely comfortable with or techniques I found useful that I want to refine and perfect.
